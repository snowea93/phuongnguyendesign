								<h4>Designers as social commentators versus Designers as social activists   </h4>
								
								<p class="excerpt">David Sterling and Mark Randall said in an interview:”The nature of graphic design often leads a designer to fulfill the role of social commentator rather than a true activist”(Sterling and Randall, cited in Heller and Vienne, 2003: p 55). The term social commentator when it comes to design means creating visual in response to social issues (Heller and Vienne, 2003: p 56). Every society has its social issues and graphic design is one of the most effective tools to depict them. However, the sad reality is graphic designers nowadays tend to work for clients and limit their communicative abilities to just serving the client’s purpose. In addition, in today’s time of advanced information and technology, anyone now can practice design through softwares and the internet. Design therefore, somewhat has lost its dignity in terms of professionalism. For this reason, it’s a challenge that designers look beyond the ordinary job and start engaging in new goals that have long-term values in society. Moreover, designers are also citizens, therefore they should always evolve themselves to progress society using their creativity and communicative abilities. </br></br>

Artists at that time objected to the idea of:”Art for art’s sake” and involved themselves in industrial design, creating works for social purposes.   </br></br>
<img src="http://www.consciousbydesign.org/uploads/5/9/9/7/5997095/6911016.jpg?519"></br>Figure 2:(Rebecca Hemstad, Face Depression)</br></br>Figure 2 is a more recent social design campaign by Rebecca Hemstad to raise the social awareness on adult depression.</br> 


								</br>On the whole, by becoming social commentators, designers are basically saying that they do care and concern for social issues. The question is: Is caring enough? This leads to the discussion regarding designers as true social activists. At the Made North design conference in June 2014, Tom Tobia expressed when asked if designers could save the world:”Rather than saving the world, let’s work on bettering our cultures, defending our liberties, and strengthening each other”(Tobia, 2014). Apparently, if designers cannot save the world, they can at least change it. Unfortunately, it’s not a sweeping process, in order to make a change, it requires more than just commentary, it requires actual action. According to Sterling and Randall, designs that make true changes are “more about function than form” (Sterling and Randall, cited in Heller and Vienne, 2003: p 56). Let’s be honest how many designers out there, who are creating posters for anti rhino poaching are actually participate in programs against it? After the event of 9/11, while many non-designers were in action to help heal the pain and the economics, graphic designers limited their responsibility to creating visuals about the event in response (Sterling and Randall, cited in Heller and Vienne, 2003: p 56). This really showed how designers were trained to look at the world with a set of aesthetic codes and were lack of social awareness.

								<h4>Designers as cultural intermediaries
</h4>
								
								<p class="excerpt">Cultural intermediaries are people who stand between the production and the consumption, who intermediately bring the products to the consumers (Negus, 2002). Designers as cultural intermediaries are best described in advertising, where designers create presentations for products that sell, and the consequence of it is the generation of cultural values and consumer behavior. Modern advertising started in the late of 19th century, in Western societies, marked by revolutionary designers like Jules Cheret or Leonetto Cappiello. Since this period witnessed the the rise of urbanisation and the context facilitated by advances in printing technology, especially color lithography, designers were expected to strongly stress on visual impact (Wharton, 2013: p 129). 
</br></br><img src="http://www.postercorner.com/v/vspfiles/photos/00618-2.jpg"></br>Figure 1:(Cappiello, Cirio, 1923.)</br></br>Figure 1 is a representative image for early modern advertising, a poster by Leonetto Cappiello. As can be seen from it, the poster showed the designer’s masterful skills in drawing and using shapes, forms and colors. The product, on the other hand, is presented in a very simple and direct way. This suggests that designers in early days of advertising sold the products mostly by expressing their art.
</br></br>Societies change through time, consequently, the style of advertising shifts. A significant change in advertising from the Jules Cheret time happened in the 1940s. This was the during and after the World War II period, advertising designers at this point no longer focused on visual styling, instead, they focused on personalizing the products (Lury, 2011: p 62). This means designers as cultural intermediaries would inform consumers about the product’s concept, the reason to consume it. 
</br></br><img src="http://corky.net/dotan/log/images/chocolate-fighting.jpg"></br>Figure 2:(Nestle, Chocolate is a fighting food, 1940.)</br></br>Figure 2 is an ad for Nestle chocolate during WWII. Understanding the  American social context of that time, Nestle personalized the product by using the heroic image of an American soldier consuming the product, in the context of a warzone (the background) to suggest high nutrition in the chocolate, it’s so rich that even soldier can survive the war with it. But more importantly, Nestle was selling the national pride through their chocolate. The campaign was rather successful because it had established a strong cultural connection with the society. 
</br></br>The next big stage of advertising started around 1965, which is also the stage that lasts till today: when advertising sells lifestyles (Lury, 2011: p 62). Designers in this stage can play the role of market segment specialist, which means to study their audience’s demographic, psychographic and ethnographic in order to identify their lifestyles and from that sell them a better one (Stone, 2010: p 7). 
</br></br><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q24Ea5XaKng/hqdefault.jpg"></br>Figure 3:(Apple, Silhouette, 2003.) 
</br></br>Figure 3 is from an advertising campaign for the Ipod. Apple particularly aimed the product to the hiphop street dancers and by showing a series of images of young people dancing to the iPod, with the use of dynamic color and graphic style, Apple presented an exciting and dynamic lifestyle. The campaign had made iPod an ultimate icon amongst street dancers as it had successfully transmitted the product value (the lifestyle it presented) to the society and turned it into a cultural value.

								<h4>Designers and the challenges in today's world</h4>
								
								<p class="excerpt">Besides the challenge for designers to walk out of the aesthetic design world and start acting for the community, there are some more challenges designers are facing today. The first one is the dominance of technology. While it provides designers with effective design tools, at the same time it takes away the purity of design, which can only be learned from the real world. Moreover, The designer’s role is more difficult to be recognized since everyone can practice design on computers now. Another challenge is the rapid change in the consumer behavior, people have started to read nutrition fact and product information, it’s almost impossible to fool consumers with advertising now and if it happens, social network will be the grave for it all. Therefore, designers need to be smarter and design products with other values than just the product itself. 
</br></br><img src="http://www.bestmasterofscienceinnursing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/10-Quality-You-Can-Trust.jpg?be53db"></br>Figure 1:(Coca Cola, Army Nurse, 1951.)</br></br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Zh7IDKU.jpg"></br>Figure 2:(Coca Cola, 2014.)</br></br>
Figure 2 is a recent campaign Coca Cola did in Vietnam. It has past the time when a nurse told you to drink Coke because it was “healthy” (figure 1). Coca Cola did an excellent job at presenting their soft drink, which is not a very healthy product as an economical and environmental-friendly image. Through this example, designers can see the more clearly the challenge to sell products in a much higher level.
